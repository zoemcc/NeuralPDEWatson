!Read regularization input
!Log the auxilliary losses
!Add parallelism to the experiment runner
!Make branch/commit the code for the PINN changes (regularization, schedule)

!Analytical solution
Stop early?
    !NANS! (during analysis)

Generate Movie
    !Create Makie Template, pick render views
    !Animation
    !Record Perspectives from interactive mode
    !Playback perspectives
    Fix glitched out
Analyze differences
    !Quadrature of deviation from analytical
    Generate Image of deviation
    Optimize for maximum deviation point

Analyze boundary condition handling
    Checking losses at asymptotic n counts match as a property test
