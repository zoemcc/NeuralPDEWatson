!Read regularization input
!Log the auxilliary losses
!Add parallelism to the experiment runner
Make branch/commit the code for the PINN changes (regularization, schedule)

Analytical solution
Stop early?

Generate Movie
    Create Makie Template, pick render views
    Animation
    Record Perspectives from interactive mode
    Playback perspectives
Analyze differences
    Quadrature of deviation from analytical
    Generate Image of deviation
    Optimize for maximum deviation

Analyze boundary condition handling
    Checking losses at asymptotic n counts match as a property test
